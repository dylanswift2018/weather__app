# Weather Application
Weather impacts nearly every area of our lives â€“ Weather conditions such as fog, rain,     
and snow impact commutes to work and travels to places in other parts of the world.

Weather impacts our health as it has a direct effect on the air we breathe (air quality),       
the water we drink, and the food we eat.

Weather impacts our safety as severe weather such as hurricanes, tornadoes,      
and floods often cause sudden mass destruction to homes, buildings, and other infrastructure.

Thanks to satellites, radar, remote sensors, and other weather monitoring technologies (such as National Weather Service alerts),    
we now have a better understanding of weather conditions and phenomena.
