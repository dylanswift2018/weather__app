# Weather Application
Weather impacts nearly every area of our lives â€“ Weather conditions such as fog, rain,     
and snow impact commutes to work and travels to places in other parts of the world.

Weather impacts our safety as severe weather such as hurricanes, tornadoes,      
and floods often cause sudden mass destruction to homes, buildings, and other infrastructure.

Thanks to satellites, radar, remote sensors, and other weather monitoring technologies (such as National Weather Service alerts),    
we now have a better understanding of weather conditions.

# Weather API 
Weather APIs are Application Programming Interfaces that allow you to connect to large databases of weather forecast and historical information.

Thanks to APIs and smartphones with built-in GPS, we have access to mobile applications that provide hour-by-hour forecasts,         
severe weather alerts, and other relevant weather information for just about every place we go.
